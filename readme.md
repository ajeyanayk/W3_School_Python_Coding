This repository contains Python scripts, which I have referred from W3-School https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp

These scripts are very basic and can easily understand by Python beginners.

I have divided the scripts into three parts 
 
 1. **Python Home** - you will find small scripts with various syntax and commands and I have tried to cover all topic in Python.
 2. **File Handling** - In this section you can understand how to open, read, write, and delete files using python scripts.
 3. **Numpy** - A type of module used for working with arrays. The scripts are in this section will show how this module work with arrays.

#### The following scripts are from Python Home, Where you can find basic command with examples

#### The following list of scripts are from File handling, Where you you can understand how to open, read, write, and delete files using python scripts.
