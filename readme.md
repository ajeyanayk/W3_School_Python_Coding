<h1 align="center">Python Scripts</h1>

<h2><ins>Background</ins> :</h2>

This repository contains Python scripts, which I have referred from [W3-School](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp).<br /> 
W3-School is good plattform to learn Python programming language escpacilly for beginners, who are instrested to learn new languages.
In this website the concepts of python programming language are clearly expalined with small examples,which will enhance the intrests on learning python.

<h2><ins>Content</ins> :</h2>

**I have divided the scripts into three parts**
 
 1. **Python Home** - you will find small scripts with various syntax and commands and I have tried to cover all topic in Python.
 2. **File Handling** - In this section you can understand how to open, read, write, and delete files using python scripts.
 3. **Numpy** - A type of module used for working with arrays. The scripts are in this section will show how this module work with arrays.

* The following scripts are from Python Home, Where you can find basic command with examples

17| 17_list_creation_input_method1.py | creation of list using input method
18| 18_list_creation_input_method2.py| creation of list using input method
19| 19_json_eg.py  | Example  for json
20| 20_regex.py| script on regular expression on various task
21| 21_regex_method.py |script on regular expression on various tasks
22| 22_str_format.py| inserting value by .format method 

* The following list of scripts are from File handling, Where you you can understand how to open, read, write, and delete files using python scripts.

| **Sl. No.** | **Script name** | **Script Description** |
----------|--------------|--------------
1| 1_read_file.py| python code,how to read the content in the file
2| 2_write_file.py| python code to write on new file
3| 3_overwrite_file.py | python code, how to re-write existing file
4| 4_creat_del_file.py| python code,how to crete a new file and delete existing file

_demofile.txt, demofile2.txt and demofile3.txt were referred file to execute to do the intended tasks_

* The following scripts are of module Numpy and will show how this module work with arrays.

| **Sl. No.** | **Script name** | **Script Description** |
----------|--------------|--------------
1| 01_numpy_sample.py| Simple script on numpy module
2| 02_numpy_dimensions.py| Displays different type of array dimensions
3| 03_ident_numpy_dimen.py | Displays different type of array dimensions
4| 04_access_numpy.py| script to access array
5| 05_slice_numpy.py| code to slice the array
6| 06_copy_View_numpy.py|  code to difference between copy and view
7| 07_shape_numpy.py | to identify the dimension of array
8| 08_reshape_numpy.py| to change the dimesnion of array
9| 09_iteration_numpy.py | iterating the array elements
10| 10_join_numpy.py| joing many arrays into one array
11| 11_split_numpy.py| spliting array into many arrays
12| 12_search_numpy.py | to search an element from array
13| 13_sort_numpy.py| sorting element
14| 14_filter_numpy.py| filtering element in arrays on condition

<h2><ins>Key Take-away</ins> :</h2>
From W3-School website I have learned the basic concepts of Python such as conditional statements, Data Structures, Creating class, inheritance, Importing Modules and Creating modules and importing in other scripts.
Similarly I have also learned File handling concepts (Reading, Writing, Creating and Deleting file), Directories and usage of Modules such as Numpy, Datetime and Random
